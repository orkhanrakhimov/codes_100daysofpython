#This is a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#Considering that there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
age = input("What is your current age?\n")
days = (90 - int(age)) * 365
weeks = (90 - int(age)) * 52
months = (90 - int(age)) * 12
print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
